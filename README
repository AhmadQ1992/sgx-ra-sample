WARNING
============================================================================

DO NOT USE THIS CODE AS A TEMPLATE FOR IMPLEMENTING REMOTE
ATTESTATION. This code short-circuits the RA process in order 
to generate an enclave quote directly!

The high-level functions provided for remote attestation take
care of the low-level details of quote generation for you:

  sgx_ra_init()
  sgx_ra_get_msg1
  sgx_ra_proc_msg2

End developers should not normally be calling these functions
directly when doing remote attestation: 

   sgx_get_ps_sec_prop()
   sgx_get_quote()
   sgx_get_quote_size()
   sgx_get_report()
   sgx_init_quote()

ABOUT
============================================================================

This application contains a dummy enclave that is used to generate Intel
SGX enclave quotes ion JSON format. These quotes are suitable for sending
to the Intel Attestation Service (in either development or production)
for validation. The intent is to give developers a means of testing their
remote attestation flows by providing a known-good quote. If the quotes
produced by this application won't validate, then there is an issue with
the SPID used to generate it, or the certificate used to communicate
with IAS (or the quote was generated in hardware simulation mode).

You must ensure that the SPID used to generate a quote for validation
by IAS must match its intended usage. Meaning, if you want to validate
a linkable quote, then the spid you supply to this program must also be
for generating linkable quotes. Generating a linkable quote with a SPID
for unlinkable quotes, or visa-versa, will produce a quote that IAS won't
validate. Similarly, quotes generated with a development/sandbox SPIDs
will not validate on the production attestations service, and visa-
versa. Last, when sending a quote to IAS, the certificate for the TLS
session ust be the one associated with that SPID.

See --help for options.

PSE SUPPORT
============================================================================

Support for platform services is only available on Windows builds, or in
Linux builds done in simulation mode. The latter is for completeness only:
quotes generated in simulation mode will not validate.
